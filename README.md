# Videodiffusion
For video training, for example a TV series, I can use the big model of stabilizediffusion when generating with lora to generate the corresponding style as well as similar to the action in the TV series, the camera change jitter, as an extension of stabilizediffusion

I want to manufacture a project like this, "for video training, for example a TV series, I can use the big model of stabilizediffusion when generating with lora to generate the corresponding style as well as similar to the action in the TV series, the camera change jitter, as an extension of stabilizediffusion", but I do not have the relevant learning, and I am looking forward to someone who can drive me to make it together and realize the principle of it.Please help me out ðŸ™‚ .
