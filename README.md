# Videodiffusion
For video training, for example a TV series, I can use the big model of  stablediffusion when generating with lora to generate the corresponding style as well as similar to the action in the TV series, the camera change jitter, as an extension of stabilizediffusion

I would like to manufacture a project like this, "For video training, for example a TV series, I can use the big model of stablediffusion when generating with lora to generate the corresponding style as well as similar to the action in the TV series, the camera change jitter, using it as an extension of a stable diffusion ", but I don't have any related learning, I expect someone can drive me to make it together and realize the principle of it. Please help me out ðŸ™‚ .
